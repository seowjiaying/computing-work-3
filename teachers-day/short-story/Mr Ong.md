**Story:**

Morning.                    I said morning.                                  **Morning                  MORNING                  I SAID MORNING**

Right, I shouldn't yell so loud.......

Oops, and now I've woken the others up!

Nevermind. It is a beautiful morning! You all shouldn't sleep in!

Goodness, what a bunch of sleepyheads!

How are you going to bed so late at night?

My good jokes ARGON if you continue to sleep

Answer me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please, your *sleeping* is so fake!

Put your heads up NOW!

You.............. you know what?

To be honest, I don't feel like waking you anymore.

Easy money can be made from me just sitting here and staring at your sleeping bodies.

Ah... but then...

Clearly, no one is going to teach you from now on.

Ha! For your exams, you are-

Eh? You are all...

Right! I knew it! You weren't all asleep! And you all do care about your studies!

So.............. I guess I should teach you guys now?

DON'T FALL ASLEEP AGAIN!

And also, can you wake the others up?

Yes, now we can start the lesson.

Now, I am sure you are wondering, why the whole dialogue?

  What is this for?

  Why is this here?
 
Well, this seems like a very good way to start the lesson:
